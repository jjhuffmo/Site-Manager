# Site-Manager
Site Manager in C#

First major program in C#.  The project will monitor and modify customer information including service tickets and assets.

Using MSSQL for its size and speed options and ability to grow into a full grown customer manager database if needed.

Trying to use as few external code snippets as possible so I can learn the language and have a better grasp on everything
it's doing instead of relying on others solving the problems.  That being said, most of the technical programming has
been taken from shared online code and modified to fit this program, instead of adjusting this program to fit into the
software code from others.
